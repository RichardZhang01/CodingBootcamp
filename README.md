Work for the coding bootcamp

## **Richard Zhang 2022**

- This is my very first attempt at using a git repo, and this will be the base for future projects (this or gitLab, unsure atm).
- My hope is to be able to emulate full-stack developers, and move toward becoming one myself. Becoming comfortable with git is one of the steps I want to take
- gitHub provides a means of keeping track of workflow and professionally managing projects between users
- I will attempt to learn the ins and outs of git. Stay tuned
